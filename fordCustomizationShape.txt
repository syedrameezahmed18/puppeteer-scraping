Year Selection
2022-2025 (can be looped on each value)  --Main loop

Once the year is selected, each year and its own type of vehicles

then we loop through those vehicle type inputs

Once the year is selected and the type is selected then each type has its own set of vehicles

then we loop through those vehicles themselves

so initial shape would be

[
    {
        year: '2022',
        vehicle_type: 'abc',
        vehicle_modal: 'the vehicle itself i.e F-750 Gas
    }
]

next phase would be to click on those vehicles and it would load a trim Section

now there would be multiple dropdowns here every value from each dropdown must be appended inside that vehicle object i.each
[
    {
        year: '2022',
        vehicle_type: 'abc',
        vehicle_modal: 'F-750 Gas'
        trim: {
            cab_style?: ['Crew cab', 'regular cab']
            ....
        }
    }
]
